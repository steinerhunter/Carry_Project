Hi there <%= @creating_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @accepting_user.name  %> has authorized the payment for your suggestion - "<%= @suggest_delivery.size %> Sized Items"!
You can go ahead and contact <%= @creating_user.name  %> on <%= @creating_user.phone %> - to set a time and a place.
Go to your <%= link_to "Activity Page", :controller => "activities", :action => "index", :host => "www.sendd.me" %> once you've completed the delivery.

Thank you,
Best Regards,
sendd.me Support
