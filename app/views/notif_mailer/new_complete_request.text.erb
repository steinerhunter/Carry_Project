Hi there <%= @creating_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @accepting_user.name  %> has completed your request - "<%= @request_delivery.what %>"!
That means your delivery has reached its destination!
Go to your <%= link_to "Activity Page", :controller => "activities", :action => "index", :host => "www.sendd.me" %> and rate <%= @accepting_user.name  %> as a transporter.

Thank you,
Best Regards,
