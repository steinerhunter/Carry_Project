Hi there <%= @creating_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @accepting_user.name  %> has delivered "<%= @request_delivery.what %>" to you!
Did you have a good sendd.me experience?
Go to the <%= link_to "Giveaway's Page", :controller => "request_deliveries", :action => "show", :id => @request_delivery.id,  :host => "www.sendd.me" %> and rate <%= @accepting_user.name  %> as a transporter.

Thank you,
Best Regards,
sendd.me Support
