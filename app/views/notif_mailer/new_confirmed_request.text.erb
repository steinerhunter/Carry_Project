Hi there <%= @accepting_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @creating_user.name  %> has confirmed you to pick up "<%= @request_delivery.what %>" for them!
You can go ahead and contact them, as well as the person giving away the item.
Go to the <%= link_to "Giveaway's Page", :controller => "request_deliveries", :action => "show", :id => @request_delivery.id,  :host => "www.sendd.me" %> and set up Pick Up and Delivery details.

Thank you,
Best Regards,
