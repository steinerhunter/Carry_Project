Hi there <%= @accepting_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @creating_user.name  %> has confirmed you for their request - "<%= @request_delivery.what %>"!
You can go ahead and contact <%= @creating_user.name  %> on <%= @creating_user.phone %> - to set a time and a place.
Go to your <%= link_to "Activity Page", :controller => "activities", :action => "index", :host => "www.sendd.me" %> once you've completed the request.

Thank you,
