Hi there <%= @accepting_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @creating_user.name  %> has confirmed you for their suggestion - "<%= @suggest_delivery.size %> Sized Items"!
In order to proceed, we need you to authorize payment preapproval.
You can do that by going to your <%= link_to "Activity Page", :controller => "activities", :action => "index", :host => "www.sendd.me" %>.

Thank you,
Best Regards,
