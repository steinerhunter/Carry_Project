Hi there <%= @creating_user.name %>,
It seems <%= @taking_user.name  %> is interested in your giveaway - "<%= @request_delivery.what %>"!
He/she must now add their location, and choose a delivery option.
<% if @creating_user.phone.present? %>
    Go to your <%= link_to "Giveaway's Page", :controller => "request_deliveries", :action => "show", :id => @request_delivery.id,  :host => "www.sendd.me" %> to view its status.
<% else  %>
    We need your phone number, so that <%= @taking_user.name  %> could contact you for the pick up.
    Go to your <%= link_to "Giveaway's Page", :controller => "request_deliveries", :action => "show", :id => @request_delivery.id,  :host => "www.sendd.me" %> and add your phone number.
<% end  %>

Thank you,
Best Regards,
sendd.me Support
