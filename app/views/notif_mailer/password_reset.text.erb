Hi there <%= @user.name %>,
We've sent you this email because someone (hopefully you) has requested a password reset.
In order to reset your password, <%= link_to "click here", edit_password_reset_url(@user.password_reset_token) %>.
If you did not request your password to be reset please ignore this email and your password will stay as it is.

Thank you,
Best Regards,
